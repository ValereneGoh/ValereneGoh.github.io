            <h4>CHAPTER 1</h4>
            <p>THE creek opening was untouched since the last time I came here. No broken twigs, no tracks of new footprints demarcating the mud-custard ground. A narrow stream meandered through the dried leaves and twigs, creating a gradient of dark hues along its path. Trees lined unevenly on both sides, making way for a small clearing of dry ground beside a sycamore with overgrown roots. </p>
            <p>I breathe in the crisp, forest scent and could almost see the air shifting around me, through the canopy, between the trunks. To any outsider the air would probably appear rock-still and they would complain about the afternoon heat. But since the Pulse hit the ground and all hell broke loose on Earth, it felt as if something in me had awaken and I was seeing the world through clearer lens. I still have not gotten used to this new sense of intimacy after six years. The feeling that my heart was beating in time with the chirping crickets, trickling water and rustling leaves all weaved together as a constant hum filling the air around me.</p>
            <p>Just five years ago I was out in the open streets of my country, scourging abandoned shops for food and clean water on my bike. The best way an apocalypse could manifest, my mom had said, before she and my older sister became victims of the mysterious illness that happened a week later. I still think about it all the time â€“they both became so weak but felt no pain, just a deep drain of energy as if they were aging internally. At least they passed peacefully.</p>
            <p>During the first month survivors congregated daily to exchange information and occasionally supplies</p>
            <p>After two months, it became apparent that either the rest of the world didn't care, or they faced a similar fate as us. Since food was running scarce, my dad, sister and I packed our essentials and travelled north to take refuge in a forest. </p>
            <p>I stooped under the branch and into the clearing, then set my bag onto the rock by the stream. Now I have learnt to navigate through the trees, hunt for food and stay out of predatorial grounds, yet still I can't get rid of that emptiness, the loss of society and people. I refilled my bottle and rinsed my face, listening to the trickle of the stream and crickets chirping</p>        
            <p>Five years of uncertainty and relentless waiting for news from the Stasis.</p>
            
            <p>Flashbacks of the Pulsing War entered my mind.</p>
            <p>I was quietly observing the fine rows of neatly trimmed angsana trees from my usual spot by the bus window, juxtaposing it against the sleek automated private cars that wheeled soundlessly past them. The bus eases into a stop and lets out a low whistle as it opened its doors for new passengers to board.</p>
            <p>"Not walking home this time?" a voice crooned from behind me, breaking me out of my reverie. I knew who it belonged to. That raw and open tone followed by a tinge of amused laughter. The boy whose spoken words sounded like bells in a class full of rowdy teenage kids, who sits far away in class but has gotten my undeserved attention since secondary one nonetheless. Ishen, captain of the school volleyball team and my first official crush which no one in the world knew. Because I was that good at keeping it secret and not doing anything about my social life. </p>
            <p>I was completely surprised that he even addressed me, not to mention how he knew I used to walk four kilometres home after school just to get a refreshing trek of what little left of nature.</p>
            <p>I cleared my throat. "No." </p>
            <p>My usual one-word answer, straight to the point. I needed more time to think of more worthy things to say. Like how he knew I walked home, or how I never came to realize we took the same bus after two whole years.</p>
            <p>I must have flung the two second rule because he gave a curt nod, swung himself around the grated purple pole and plodded his way up the steps to the back seat of the bus. I resumed my staring out the window from where I stood.</p>
            <p>The next ten minutes happened too quickly. After about five stops the bus started a series of jerking and vehicles started to break down outside, causing a domino of car crashes and honking. The passengers including myself alighted the bus to the pavement. The sight of the road and all its stationary cars became the next thing on my list of still images for the weary mind sketch series. Breaking out of my reverie, I was prepared to make my journey home. </p>
            <p>Then I heard Ishen complaining that his phone wasn't working and noted that he wasn't the only one. Some frustrated people got out of their vehicles to access the extent of the situation, only to find that everyone else were equally helpless and confused. Some shouted across cars or talked to their neighbours, trying to make sense of what just happened.</p>
            <p>Then after about a minute of walking alongside the jam, a giant rush of air seemed to come from the ground, carrying the strangest scent with it. Fresh and organic. There was no wind, just the sensation of an odd energy boost in my body. It became visible that some people picked them up, because the one thing that followed was the murmur of "Did you feel that?" echoing from those within earshot. </p>
            <p>Who knew that the death of technology would present itself as the apocalypse of the world. </p>
