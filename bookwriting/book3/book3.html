            <h3>PART 1: The Inner Stasis</h3>
            <p>Rae is now undercover in the Stasis and has to attend meetings and help rebuild her home. She learns a lot more about the intergalactic system and dreams and parallel universes, but also genuinely wants to find out more about Elven. She acts as if she is against him but tbh she really doesn’t know him that well and all the information found makes her think that he is really a criminal. Because she is now associated with dreams and Gaia, the Stasis disallows her from interacting with the humans of Gaia because they must “forge the connection with Gaia themselves”. She gets angry that she could not help the humans if she doesn’t meet and speak to them, so she makes a deal that if she can get response/reaction from her family from afar in the interspace, she can return to Earth and do her job. She fails and the leader of the Stasis moves her to the creation of a new Planet X and asks her to leave the rebuild Gaia project as punishment. At the end of part 1, she meets a new secretary member of the Planet X project who reads her mind, jolting her memory of Elven, met by a twinkle in his eye.</li>
            <h3>PART 2: The Observatory</h3>
            <p>Filled with witty conversations, the new secretary member drops a lot of subtle hints and puzzling sentences that makes her suspect his identity. When she questions him, however, he quells her suspicions, making her very confused. They got closer, however, just like how she easily got close to Elven in book 1, and share an intimate moment in the nonspace, a relaxing place like stargazing in the intergalactic. There, it is revealed that he really is Elven, and has been hiding his identity because they were being watched. He says he misses her and this time she says really? How come I don’t know much about you nor why out of all the beautiful intergalactic creatures out there you choose me? We learn much more about Elven here. It ends with Elven revealing what the Stasis really plans to do with the creatures of Gaia, and how they, along with Elven’s trusted group of intergalactic friends, plan to stop it. Rae is vital to the mission as she has direct connections to Gaia and the Stasis. Rae is reluctant as she doesn’t like to take risks and is afraid that Elven might be pretending to like her only to use her to save the creatures of Gaia. But she eventually agrees as she wants to save her family too.</li>
            <h3>PART 3: Dream-knitted</h3>
            <p>Now Rae acts in favour of the Stasis leader as part of the rebuild Gaia project and gains his trust. She becomes close friends with Gaia and tells her of the Stasis plans to her creatures, while executing the plans to destroy/fail the Stasis’ plans in secret. Gaia feels cheated and is grateful for her help and asks her what she can do in return. She asks for one normal day with her family. She gets it, in dream form, in her home, her family with no recollection of her disappearance or the Pulse. She says sorry to her parents, for letting them down and not being good enough, and parents comforts her by saying don’t worry, it’s okay and even making jokes about having another chance (alternate dimension?). She bursts into tears in her room and cries to sleep, waking up from her dream. At the end, she destroys the Stasis secret plan to erase the memories of the humans (through dreams) by defeating the black hooded guy in the dream – she now has an extraordinary ability to control her dreams from being exposed to too many dreams simulations.</p>
