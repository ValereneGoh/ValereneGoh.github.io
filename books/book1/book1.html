            <h3>PART 1: The Stasis</h3>
            <p>Five years after the Pulse, Rae, her father and younger sister lives in the Jakarta forest as part of the Stasis agreement of resettlement. On one of Stasis reports, she meets Elven who had joined the Stasis (initially she thought it was something like the UN, formed after the Pulse took place) as a reporter undercover and was on the biannual week-long report for the land of Jakarta. She notices he behaves differently from the other reporters that came in previous years. He discovers (in secret) that she has powers of wind and is able to read her mind (sometimes), which triggers his memory of a little girl he met in the past on one of his secret missions to Earth.</li>
            <h3>PART 2: Gaia</h3>
            <p>Rae understands about Gaia and the system of planets and creatures. Elven reveals abit about how the humans in the Stasis made a deal with the true stasis (alien-visited) that they would give up the jade on their planet (found at Jade Mountain in China) for pardon from being wiped from Earth. The true intentions from both sides are not revealed and Elven says he is still trying to figure out. It ends with her making a real connection to Gaia (not verbally), much to Gaia’s surprise, that if she passes the dream trials as a probationary member of the Stasis she will be an official member (to rebuild Gaia) and Earth’s survivors would be spared as part of the reboot.</li>
            <h3>PART 3: The Dream Trials</h3>
            <p>She undergoes the dream trials to become a member of the true Stasis (an intergalactic organisation aimed at maintaining the balance and flow of aura. Creatures of Gaia were stifling her aura, which was affecting other planets) to save the creatures of Gaia (in particular, the humans) from being wiped out. Elven says he will be with her throughout the dream trials and Rae has a quick thought of why she trusts him so much, since she barely knows him. They have an intimate moment (awkward Rae) in which Elven read her mind – at this point she didn’t know – and he says he will reveal to her when the time is right. During the dream trials – Rae knows barely a thing about the dream world – she encounters the black hooded guy who chases her quite a bit. She doesn’t really know what she is doing in the dream or what she is supposed to prove or achieve; but she wakes up for three/five consecutive days in seemingly a time period that is before the Pulse occurred – a normal day in school, with her friends. For these days she keeps thinking a part of her memory has been removed and that the Pulse never happened and it was all a dream. At the end of the dream trials she wakes up to realise she somehow passed the trials but someone from the Stasis has accused Elven and he is now a wanted intergalactic criminal.</p>
