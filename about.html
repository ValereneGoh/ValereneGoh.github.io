                    <p>Hi! I'm Valerene Goh. Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I code, write, draw and sing in private. I use this space to document and explore life. Feel free to explore but keep in mind that this webpage was originally created as a private "logbook", so alot of the stuff here are unpolished and uncompleted. But now that it's out there, if you happen to stumble upon my webpage, let me tell you a little more about myself!</p>
                    <p>The first third of my life has been nothing short of fun, centered mainly around the arts. I read alot and got so inspired by fantasy books that I started to illustrate and write my own stories. They were never completed, of course, but the joy of letting my imagination run wild with adventure is why I never quite stopped writing and being creative until today. If you look under the Explore tab of my webpage, there is a category called "Books" where I tentatively wrote a bit of what I'm currently working on (though really slowly since I'm busy with school).</p>
                    <p>I grew up in a household of five girls, me being the second oldest. When I was around ten I had this idea of producing a concert (with dancing and singing in them) for my family since we had enough people in the house to both perform and watch. It was an unprofessional setup but still loads of fun. We continued this for several years until I grew out of it (as I was usually the one who initiated all the crazy stuff). When the movie Frozen came out, I got so inspired that I went to write a short script of the movie and that year-end we produced our first family "musical", with props, audio recordings and all (Yea, we recorded our voices singing but also sang live on the day itself, much to our own embarassment).</p>
                    <p>Another fun phase of my childhood was when my older sister and I created "Flying Dreams School", where we taught the three younger ones in front of a white board, complete with self-made worksheets, a school email to send announcements to their "parents", a school website to update our family of concerts and events and even a school song called "Flying Dreams" with harmonies.</p>
                    <p>The second third of my life was covered in blogging, more intense musical studies and choir, the thing that got me pretty good at singing. Because of my musical background, I was appointed section leader and later student conductor. Due to my reserved nature, I worked really hard to improve my singing so I could be less afraid to sing in front of others and eventually be able to properly teach them. After a few months it paid off and now I even feel more qualified to teach singing than the violin or piano, as I have had more experience on the former than the latter. Nevertheless, for a long time I continued to further my musical studies, taking Higher Music for leveled exam and thereafter furthering my studies into diplomas.</p>
                    <p>I was also doing really well in school, getting within the top ten in cohort and sometimes topping my class. I thoroughly enjoyed art class and D&T lesson (design and technology) because I was really good at drawing and my art teacher even offered me to take Art Elective for exams. I declined of course, saying that I was already planning to take Music Elective.</p>
                    <p>Then the time came when I had to choose what course I was going to take for University. Somehow I knew that though music was a really large part of my life, I wanted something more. I didn't want it to be the only thing that defined me as I knew there were more areas I could explore given my wide range of interests and unlocked potential. So I took a dive for the unknown and signed up for Engineering in SUTD.</p>
                    <p>A large part of my decision was that I still couldn't decide which career path to take (as in what degree I was going to go for) and SUTD allowed for one extra year before settling down on a major. I was still a rather artsy student in a school full of science-minded people and that took quite a while to settle into. But eventually I found myself quite liking it, because what defined me wasn't my art capabilities but rather my love for learning new skills and getting better at them. Within the first year, I tried and experienced many new things like Arduino (an electronic prototyping microcontroller), 3D-printing, laser-cutting, coding, CADding and Adobe skills. It was intimidating at first to see so many people who already had extensive prior knowledge in these areas, but the one thing that came out of it was that they all started somewhere and this was where I needed to start. The highlight of my first year, though, wasn't so much of the 3D-printing and Python programming, but the rather CCAs (we call it fifth rows) that I actively participated in: showchoir, Funk, competitive swimming, contemporary dance and bands.</p>
                    <p>In my second year, I chose to take the programming route (ISTD). To be really honest, I wasn't that much into programming at that point but chose it banyway for two main reasons: I wasn't bad at it (I'm pretty logical) and it would grant me a secure career path (which music and the arts does not guarantee). Now, however, looking back, I think I made the right choice. Within the first and only (yes, Year 2 only lasts for three months in SUTD. You don't get that much smarter from Year 2 to 3.) term as a Sophomore, I discovered Android Studio and made my first two android apps. That was the first time I involuntarily got so engrossed in coding for weeks at a time and it hit me that perhaps there really was a true place for this arts-driven girl within the field of software engineering. I decided then that front-end development and UI/UX design was definitely something I wanted to pursue. Creating apps and webpages felt really rewarding, especially when you can obviously see the fruits of your labour.</p>
                    <p>So lo and behold, that term ended and now we are almost up to date. I decided to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that I could experience a little of web design and did this during what was left of my busy holiday. It took about one week to learn the basics and then school started and my experimentation is now put on hold. Dance also became a huge part of my life in this third season and I have an upcoming dance (and also chamber) production - the first one I'll be in. My life has been filled with ups and downs (I realize I wasn't painting a balanced picture of that), but at this point it feels like it's at a trough going upward. My first internship will mark my first practical experience as a programmer and I'm equally stoked as I am nervous.</p>
                    <p>Wow, I can't believe you've read all the way down here. Here's to my future self: Never stop trying. Cheers to the celebration of life.</p>
