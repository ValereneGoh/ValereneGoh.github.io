                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>More than half my life has been submerged in various forms of music! I play the piano, violin, sing, dance and I've also picked up the guitar a couple of times. Music feeds the soul and that's why I love it.</p>

                    <h3>Writing</h3>
                    <p>Okay, I've never been top of my class for writing, but it's been a constant for as long as I can remember. I used to write stories when I was small, illustrate them and let my imagination run wild! I also wrote small plays for my family during the holidays. I blogged alot, wrote songs and now I journal.</p>

                    <p>Dance, portraiture and coding are areas that gained more significance in the later years of my life. I may still showcase some of it here, but bear with me if they are a little amateur-ish! Mostly I'm still learning and exploring these areas, but if anything, I know that they are here to stay!</p>
